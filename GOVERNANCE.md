# Overview

This is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an
interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project
design and participate in the decision making process. This document describes
how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within
the project community.

# Roles and responsibilities

## Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most
important members of the community and without them the project would have no
purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

The project asks its users to participate in the project and community as much
as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are
satisfying the needs of those users. Common user contributions include (but are
not limited to):

- evangelising about the project (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth
awareness raising)
- informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
- providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often
become more and more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming
contributors, as described in the next section.

## Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the
project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many
forms. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill
requirements and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves
doing one or more of the following:

- supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support
new users)
- reporting bugs
- identifying requirements
- review code contributions
- programming
- assisting with project infrastructure
- writing documentation
- fixing bugs
- adding features
- providing graphics and web design

Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker and mailing
list, or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the
project itself via patches, which will be considered for inclusion in the
project by existing maintainers (see next section). The developer mailing list
is the most appropriate place to ask for help when making that first
contribution.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile
within, and commitment to, the community will increase.
A contributer who shows an above-average level of contribution to the project,
particularly with respect to its strategic direction and long-term health, may
be nominated to become a maintainer. This role is described below.

## Maintainers 

Maintainers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the
continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the
community.

Typically, a potential maintainer will need to show that they have an
understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. They will also
have provided valuable contributions to the project over a period of time.

The project maintainers consists of those individuals identified as
‘project owners’ on the development site. The maintainers have additional
responsibilities over and above those of a contributor. These responsibilities
ensure the smooth running of the project. Maintainers are expected to review
and merge code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve
changes to the governance model and manage the copyrights within the project
outputs.

Maintainers do not have significant authority over other members of the
community, although they make decisions when community consensus cannot be
reached. In addition, maintainers may interact through the project’s private
mailing list if it exists or directly based on the maintainers list.
This list is used for sensitive issues, such as votes for new maintainers and
legal matters that cannot be discussed in public. It is never used for project
management or planning.

Maintainer membership is by invitation from the existing members. A nomination
will result in discussion and then a vote by the existing maintainers on the
project’s private list.
Maintainer membership votes are subject to consensus approval of the current
maintainer members.

# Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new
users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as
a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognise that all
support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as
and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results
should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a community member.
However, for those willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and
willing to help support other users, the community support channels are ideal.

# Contribution process

Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are
many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the
project mailing list and issue tracker, or might supply patches.

# Decision making process

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all
members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced
maintainer member. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place
on the project developer mailing list. Occasionally, sensitive discussion
occurs on a private list.

In order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion
and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This
allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.

## Lazy consensus

Decision making typically involves the following steps:

- Proposal
- Discussion
- Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)
- Decision

Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In
order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should send an email to
the project developer list or submit a patch implementing the idea to the
issue tracker (or version-control system if they have commit access). This will
prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this
review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most
people in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little
need for discussion in order to reach consensus.

In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is
recognised as having the support of the community. This is called lazy
consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have
implicitly agreed to the implementation of the proposal.

Lazy consensus is a very important concept within the project. It is this
process that allows a large group of people to efficiently reach consensus, as
someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their
position, and others need not spend time reading such mails.

For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours
before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement
ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the
proposal. This time period is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of
all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.

#  Voting

Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those
affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of the project must gain
explicit approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is
encouraged to express their opinions in all discussion and all votes. However,
only project maintainer members (as defined above) have binding votes for the
purposes of decision making.

Ross Gardler and Gabriel Hanganu. 
http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel

The document has been modified to fit the needs of the Nmstate project.
These are the main changes done from the original template:
- Roles: The commiter role has been dropped and PMC members have been renamed
to be called maintainers.
  In addition, the PMC chair role has not been mentioned.
- Providing financial support for the project has not been mentioned.
